# mini-workflow-tools

A collection of CLI tools I've created to learn the [Odin programming language](https://odin-lang.org/). None of these are intended to be 
production ready robust code, purely created as a learning exercise and to streamline certain aspects of my day to day development.

## Tools

*   **kill-port:** A utility to kill a process running on a specific port.
*   **cli:** A collection of Odin modules used to build the tools in this repo (e.g., colors, spinners).
